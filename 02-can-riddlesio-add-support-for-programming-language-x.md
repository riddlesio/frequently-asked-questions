## Can Riddles.io add support for programming language X?

Certainly. Riddles.io can add support for any programming language if you 
open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/riddlesio/issues/issues) 
containing the following information:

- A link to the source code for a working starter bot written in programming 
  language X;
- Instructions to compile the starter bot;
- Instructions to run the starter bot.

Note that we currently do not support any compile step that requires an active 
network connection.
