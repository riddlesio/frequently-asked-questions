## How does my bot earn points?

In multiplayer games, your bot will automatically earn points when it's
activated. You can activate your preferred bot revision on the overview
page of a competition. After that it will appear on the leaderboard and
ranked matches are scheduled for your bot against the other activated bots.
Challenging other bots will not influence the bot's score.

In singleplayer games the bot will earn points by pressing ASSESS NOW on
the overview page of the competition on your preferred bot revision. A game
will be played against some secret assessment data.
The bot revision with the highest score counts and that score will appear
on the leaderboard.
