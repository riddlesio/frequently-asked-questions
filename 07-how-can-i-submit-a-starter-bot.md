### How do I submit a starter bot?

You can submit a starter bot for any game by creating an issue on the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/riddlesio/issues/issues).

The issue should contain the following information:

  1. A link to the source code for the starter bot;
  2. The game for which the starter bot is made;
  3. The programming language in which the starter bot is written.

The started bot will be made available on the website after review.
