## Can I test my bot before uploading?

Yes, Riddles.io usually open sources game engines after
launching a competition. The source code, as well as the compiled releases
can be downloaded from the [Riddles.io Github page](https://github.com/riddlesio/).
You'll also find a link to the game engine source on the How to Play page of
a competition.

A very useful tool for local testing can be found [here](https://github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace).
